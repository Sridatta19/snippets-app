    'When we released the first version of cosmOS last year, it was written in Go. Go is a wonderful programming language, but it’s been a while since I’ve seen an article on the front page of Hacker News about rewriting some important tool in Go and I see articles on there about rewriting things in Rust every single week.',
}

export default (props) => <SnippetLayout meta={meta} {...props} />

This mental model is INCREDIBLY useful for all sorts of intermediate-advanced typings:

If TypeScript knows a value can't change, it'll infer it to its literal type.

```ts

const moreTsPeople = {
  Andarist: 'Andarist',
  Titian: 'Titian',
  Devansh: 'Devansh',
  Anurag: 'Anurag',
} as const
