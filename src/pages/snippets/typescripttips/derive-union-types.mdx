```ts
export const fruitCounts = {
  apple: 1,
  banana: 6,
  pear: 24,
}

// Previously
type SingleFruitCount =
  | {
      apple: number
    }
  | {
      banana: number
    }
  | {
      pear: number
    }

type FruitCounts = typeof fruitCounts

// Newly
type NewSingleFruitCount = {
  [K in keyof FruitCounts]: {
    [K2 in K]: number
  }
}[keyof FruitCounts]

const singleFruitCount: NewSingleFruitCount = {
  banana: 12,
}
```
