    'When we released the first version of cosmOS last year, it was written in Go. Go is a wonderful programming language, but it’s been a while since I’ve seen an article on the front page of Hacker News about rewriting some important tool in Go and I see articles on there about rewriting things in Rust every single week.',

export default (props) => <SnippetLayout meta={meta} {...props} />

```ts

myObj['foo']?.push('bar')

if (!myObj.foo) {
  myObj.foo = []
}

myObj.foo.push('bar')
```
