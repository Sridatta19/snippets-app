Deriving vs Declaring is key to getting the most inference out of your types with as few lines of code as possible.

But sometimes, you want to _ensure_ that some code conforms to a type without losing its literal values.

Enter satisfies()()

```ts
const num = satisfies<number>()(2)

// type Action = 'view' | 'create' | 'update' | 'delete'
// type Role = 'anonymous' | 'admin' | 'loggedIn'

export const userActions: {
  type: Action
  roles: Role[]
}[] = [
  {
    type: 'view',
    roles: ['anonymous', 'admin'],
  },
  {
    type: 'create',
    roles: ['admin'],
  },
  {
    type: 'update',
    roles: ['admin', 'loggedIn'],
  },
  {
    type: 'delete',
    roles: ['admin'],
  },
]

type Action = typeof userActions[number]['type']
type Role = typeof userActions[number]['roles'][number]
```
