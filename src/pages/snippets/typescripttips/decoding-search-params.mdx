    'When we released the first version of cosmOS last year, it was written in Go. Go is a wonderful programming language, but it’s been a while since I’ve seen an article on the front page of Hacker News about rewriting some important tool in Go and I see articles on there about rewriting things in Rust every single week.',

TypeScript's string interpolation powers are incredible, especially since 4.1. Add some utilities from ts-toolbelt, and you've got a stew going.

Here, we decode some URL search params AT THE TYPE LEVEL.

```ts
import { String, Union } from 'ts-toolbelt'

const query = `/home?a=foo&b=wow`

type Query = typeof query

type SecondaryQueryPart = String.Split<Query, '?'>[1]

type QueryElements = String.Split<SecondaryQueryPart, '&'>

type QueryParams = {
  [QueryElement in QueryElements[number]]: {
    [Key in String.Split<QueryElement, '='>[0]]: String.Split<
      QueryElement,
      '='
    >[1]
  }
}[QueryElements[number]]

const obj: Union.Merge<QueryParams> = {
  a: 'foo',
  b: 'wow',
}
```
