Generics can be 'locked in' by function calls, meaning that generics can be 'curried' through functions.

Here, we create a 'key remover' function which can process any generic object.

```ts
export const makeKeyRemover =
  <Key extends string>(keys: Key[]) =>
  <Obj>(obj: Obj): Omit<Obj, Key> => {
    return {} as any
  }

const keyRemover = makeKeyRemover(['a', 'b'])

const newObject = keyRemover({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 })

newObject.c
```
