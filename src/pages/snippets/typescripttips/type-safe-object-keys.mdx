The looseness of Object.keys can be a real pain point when using TypeScript. Luckily, it's pretty simple to create a tighter version using generics and the keyof operator.

```ts
export const myObject = {
  a: 1,
  b: 2,
  c: 3,
}

const objectKeys = <Obj>(obj: Obj): (keyof Obj)[] => {
  return Object.keys(obj) as (keyof Obj)[]
}

objectKeys(myObject).forEach((key) => {
  console.log(myObject[key])
})
```
