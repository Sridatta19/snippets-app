Using a crazy trick I picked up from, you can throw detailed error messages for type checks.

Here, I move a runtime check in a function to the type level, meaning you get a detailed error if you use it wrong.

```ts
type CheckForBadArgs<Arg> = Arg extends any[]
  ? 'You cannot compare two arrays'
  : Arg

export const deepEqualCompare = <Arg>(
  a: CheckForBadArgs<Arg>,
  b: CheckForBadArgs<Arg>
): boolean => {
  return a === b
}

deepEqualCompare(1, 2)
deepEqualCompare([1], [2])
```
