Type helpers change the game when it comes to types in your codebase. They help TypeScript infer more from your code - and make your types a lot more readable.

Here, I write my own PropsFrom helper to extract props from any React component.

```ts
import React from 'react'

const MyComponent = (props: { enabled: boolean }) => {
  return null
}

class MyOtherComponent extends React.Component<{
  enabled: boolean
}> {}

type PropsFrom<TComponent> = TComponent extends React.FC<infer Props>
  ? Props
  : TComponent extends React.Component<infer Props>
  ? Props
  : never

const props: PropsFrom<typeof MyComponent> = {
  enabled: true,
}
```
