    'When we released the first version of cosmOS last year, it was written in Go. Go is a wonderful programming language, but it’s been a while since I’ve seen an article on the front page of Hacker News about rewriting some important tool in Go and I see articles on there about rewriting things in Rust every single week.',

export default (props) => <SnippetLayout meta={meta} {...props} />

Ever wanted just a _bit_ of autocomplete?

Here, we create a TypeScript helped called LooseAutocomplete which gives us autocomplete while also allowing arbitrary values.

```ts
type IconSize = 'xs' | 'md' | Omit<string, 'xs' | 'md'>
type IconSizeNew = 'xs' | 'md' | (`xs${string}` & {})

interface IconProps {
  size: IconSizeNew
}

export const Icon = (props: IconProps) => {
  return <></>
}

const Comp1 = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <Icon size="xs"></Icon>
      <Icon size="xssomething"></Icon>
      <Icon size="md"></Icon>
    </>
  )
}
```
