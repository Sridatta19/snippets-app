You can DRY up your generics code MASSIVELY (and improve perf) by assigning local variables to default generic slots.

Here, we move some complex 'Extract' logic to a generic slot, meaning it only gets calculated once.

```ts
export type Obj = {
  a: 'FOO'
  a2: 'a2'
  a3: 'a3'
  b: 'b'
  b1: 'b1'
  b2: 'b2'
}

type ValuesOfKeysStartingWithA<
  Obj,
  _ExtractedKeys extends keyof Obj = Extract<keyof Obj, `a${string}`>
> = {
  [K in _ExtractedKeys]: Obj[K]
}[_ExtractedKeys]

type NewUnion = ValuesOfKeysStartingWithA<Obj>
```
