Count the number of times a depth measurement increases

```
Sample Data
---------------
199 (N/A - no previous measurement)
200 (increased)
208 (increased)
210 (increased)
200 (decreased)
207 (increased)
240 (increased)
269 (increased)
260 (decreased)
263 (increased)
```

> Q) How many measurements are larger than the previous measurement?

### Solution

```js
const solution = pipe(
  aperture(2),
  map(([a, b]) => b > a),
  filter(equals(true)),
  length
)
```

## Part Two: three-measurement sliding window

```
199  A
200  A B
208  A B C
210    B C D
200  E   C D
207  E F   D
240  E F G
269    F G H
260      G H
263        H
```

```
A: 607 (N/A - no previous sum)
B: 618 (increased)
C: 618 (no change)
D: 617 (decreased)
E: 647 (increased)
F: 716 (increased)
G: 769 (increased)
H: 792 (increased)
```

> Q) Consider sums of a three-measurement sliding window. How many sums are larger than the previous sum?

```js
const solution = pipe(
  aperture(3),
  map(sum),
  aperture(2),
  map(([a, b]) => b > a),
  filter(equals(true)),
  length
)
```
