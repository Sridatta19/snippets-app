    'When we released the first version of cosmOS last year, it was written in Go.

Consider the following horizontal positions:

16,1,2,0,4,2,7,1,2,14
This means there's a crab with horizontal position 16, a crab with horizontal position 1, and so on.

Each change of 1 step in horizontal position of a single crab costs 1 fuel. You could choose any horizontal position to align them all on, but the one that costs the least fuel is horizontal position 2:

```
Move from 16 to 2: 14 fuel
Move from 1 to 2: 1 fuel
Move from 2 to 2: 0 fuel
Move from 0 to 2: 2 fuel
Move from 4 to 2: 2 fuel
Move from 2 to 2: 0 fuel
Move from 7 to 2: 5 fuel
Move from 1 to 2: 1 fuel
Move from 2 to 2: 0 fuel
Move from 14 to 2: 12 fuel
```

> Q) How much fuel must they spend to align to that position?

```js
const diff = R.curry((a, b) => Math.abs(R.subtract(a, b)))

const final = data.split(',').map(Number)

const arr = sequenceGen(Math.min(...final) - 1, Math.max(...final) + 1)

const solution = R.pipe(
  R.map((a) => final.map((b) => diff(a, b))),
  R.map(R.sum),
  R.reduce(R.minBy(R.identity), Infinity)
)(arr)
```

## Part Two: dynamic fuel burn rate

As each crab moves, moving further becomes more expensive. This changes the best horizontal position to align them all on; in the example above, this becomes 5:

```
Move from 16 to 5: 66 fuel
Move from 1 to 5: 10 fuel
Move from 2 to 5: 6 fuel
Move from 0 to 5: 15 fuel
Move from 4 to 5: 1 fuel
Move from 2 to 5: 6 fuel
Move from 7 to 5: 3 fuel
Move from 1 to 5: 10 fuel
Move from 2 to 5: 6 fuel
Move from 14 to 5: 45 fuel
```

> Q) How much fuel must they spend to align to that position?

```js
const diff = R.curry((a, b) => Math.abs(R.subtract(a, b)))

const final = data.split(',').map(Number)

const arr = sequenceGen(Math.min(...final) - 1, Math.max(...final) + 1)

const power = (n) => R.divide(R.multiply(n, n + 1), 2)

const solution = R.pipe(
  R.map((a) => final.map((b) => diff(a, b))),
  R.map(R.map(power)),
  R.map(R.sum),
  R.reduce(R.minBy(R.identity), Infinity)
)(arr)
```
