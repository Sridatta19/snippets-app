So, suppose you have a lanternfish with an internal timer value of 3:

- After one day, its internal timer would become 2.
- After another day, its internal timer would become 1.
- After another day, its internal timer would become 0.
- After another day, its internal timer would reset to 6, and it would create a new lanternfish with an internal timer of 8.
- After another day, the first lanternfish would have an internal timer of 5, and the second lanternfish would have an internal timer of 7.

```
Initial state: 3,4,3,1,2
After  1 day:  2,3,2,0,1
After  2 days: 1,2,1,6,0,8
After  3 days: 0,1,0,5,6,7,8
After  4 days: 6,0,6,4,5,6,7,8,8
After  5 days: 5,6,5,3,4,5,6,7,7,8
After  6 days: 4,5,4,2,3,4,5,6,6,7
After  7 days: 3,4,3,1,2,3,4,5,5,6
After  8 days: 2,3,2,0,1,2,3,4,4,5
After  9 days: 1,2,1,6,0,1,2,3,3,4,8
After 10 days: 0,1,0,5,6,0,1,2,2,3,7,8
After 11 days: 6,0,6,4,5,6,0,1,1,2,6,7,8,8,8
After 12 days: 5,6,5,3,4,5,6,0,0,1,5,6,7,7,7,8,8
After 13 days: 4,5,4,2,3,4,5,6,6,0,4,5,6,6,6,7,7,8,8
After 14 days: 3,4,3,1,2,3,4,5,5,6,3,4,5,5,5,6,6,7,7,8
After 15 days: 2,3,2,0,1,2,3,4,4,5,2,3,4,4,4,5,5,6,6,7
After 16 days: 1,2,1,6,0,1,2,3,3,4,1,2,3,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,8
After 17 days: 0,1,0,5,6,0,1,2,2,3,0,1,2,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,7,8
After 18 days: 6,0,6,4,5,6,0,1,1,2,6,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4,6,7,8,8,8,8
```

> Q) How many lanternfish would there be after 80 days?

```js
const solution = R.reduce(
  (acc) => {
    const fn = R.cond([
      [R.equals(0), R.or([6, 8])],
      [R.T, R.dec],
    ])
    return R.pipe(R.map(fn), R.flatten)(acc)
  },
  data.split(','),
  sequenceGen(0, 81)
).length
```

## Part Two: forever lanternfishes

> Q) How many lanternfish would there be after 256 days?

```js
function reducer(acc, [a, b]) {
  if (a == 0) {
    return R.append(['6', b], R.append(['8', b], acc))
  }
  return R.append([R.dec(a), b], acc)
}

function reducify(acc, list) {
  return R.pipe(
    R.reduce(reducer, []),
    R.map(R.of),
    R.map(R.fromPairs),
    R.reduce(R.mergeWith(R.add), {}),
    R.toPairs
  )(acc)
}

const array = R.pipe(R.split(','), R.countBy(R.identity), R.toPairs)(data)

const solution = R.pipe(
  R.reduce(reducify, array),
  R.fromPairs,
  R.values,
  R.sum
)(sequenceGen(0, 257))
```
