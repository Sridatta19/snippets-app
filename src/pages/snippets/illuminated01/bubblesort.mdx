    'When we released the first version of cosmOS last year, it was written in Go. Go is a wonderful programming language, but it’s been a while since I’ve seen an article on the front page of Hacker News about rewriting some important tool in Go and I see articles on there about rewriting things in Rust every single week.',

### Problem

Input: array A of n distinct integers.<br/>
Output: array with the same integers, sorted from
smallest to largest.

<Callout title="Pseudo Code">
  Identify adjacent pairs of elements that are out of order order, and perform
  repeated swaps until the entire array is sorted
</Callout>

### Solution

```rust
pub fn bubble_sort<T: PartialOrd + Copy>(list: &mut [T]) -> &mut [T] {
    for i in 0..list.len() {
        for j in 0..list.len() {
            if list[i] < list[j] {
                list.swap(i, j);
            }
        }
    }

    list
}
```
