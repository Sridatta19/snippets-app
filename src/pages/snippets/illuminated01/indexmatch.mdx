You are given a sorted (from smallest to largest) array
A of n distinct integers which can be positive, negative, or zero. You
want to decide whether or not there is an index i such that A[i] = i.
Design the fastest algorithm you can for solving this problem

<Callout title="Pseudo Code">
  Check if middle element is the solution
  <br />C := recursively check middle of first half of A<br />D := recursively check
  middle of second half of A<br />
</Callout>

### Solution

```rust
pub fn index_match<T>(list: &[T]) -> bool
where
    T: PartialOrd + Copy + TryInto<usize> + TryFrom<usize>,
    usize: TryInto<T>,
    <usize as TryInto<T>>::Error: std::fmt::Debug,
    <T as TryInto<usize>>::Error: std::fmt::Debug,
{
    if list.len() == 0 {
        return false;
    }

    let half = list.len() / 2;

    if list[half] == half.try_into().unwrap() {
        return true;
    }

    if list[half] > half.try_into().unwrap() {
        return index_match(&list[..half]);
    } else {
        return index_match(&list[0..half]);
    }
}
```
