### Problem

Input: array A of n distinct integers.<br/>
Output: array with the same integers, sorted from
smallest to largest.

<Callout title="Pseudo Code">
  Scan through the input array to identify the minimum element and copy it over
  to the first element of the output array; then do another scan to identify and
  copy over the second-smallest element; and so on
</Callout>

### Solution

```rust
pub fn selection_sort<T: PartialOrd + Copy>(list: &mut [T]) -> &mut [T] {
    let mut min: usize;
    for i in 0..list.len() {
        min = i;
        for j in i..list.len() {
            if list[j] < list[min] {
                min = j;
            }
        }

        if min != i {
            list.swap(i, min);
        }
    }

    list
}
```
