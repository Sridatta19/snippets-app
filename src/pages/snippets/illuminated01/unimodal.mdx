### Unimodal array

Its entries are in increasing order up until its maximum
element, after which its elements are in decreasing order.

Give an
algorithm to compute the maximum element of a unimodal array that
runs in O(log n) time.

<Callout title="Pseudo Code">
  Check if middle element is the solution
  <br />C := recursively check middle of first half of A<br />D := recursively check
  middle of second half of A<br />
</Callout>

### Solution

```rust
fn unimodal<T>(list: &[T]) -> Option<T>
where
    T: PartialOrd + Copy + std::fmt::Debug,
{
    if list.len() <= 2 {
        return None;
    }

    let half = list.len() / 2;

    if list[half] > list[half - 1] && list[half] > list[half + 1] {
        return Some(list[half]);
    }

    if list[half] > list[half - 1] && list[half + 1] > list[half] {
        return unimodal(&list[half..]);
    } else {
        return unimodal(&list[0..half]);
    }
}

pub fn main() {
    let list: Vec<u32> = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8];

    match unimodal(&list) {
        Some(ans) => println!("printing unimodal head {}", ans),
        None => println!("not an unimodal array"),
    };
}
```
